Using addons

Add-ons are neat packages you can install and use with Storybook to gain additional functionality.

Let's add a documentation add-on which will allow us to create beautiful design system documentation.

Run the following command to install a few add-ons.

npm i -D @storybook/preset-create-react-app actions @storybook/addon-docs

We then need to tell Storybook that we'll be using this add-on and we can do that in main.js.

We'll be creating our documentation and stories using MDX. MDX is a format which lets you write JSX in your markdown files, and we can use it to create stories and documentation.

We can use MDX to document our components and create a style guide for our design system. To do that, we'll need a few additional things, known as add-ons.

Add the following to the addons array in main.js.

module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.(js|mdx)"],
  addons: ["@storybook/preset-create-react-app", "@storybook/addon-docs"]
};

Now we can document and create stories for our button components.

import { Meta, Story, Preview } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import { PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, TertiaryButton } from "./Buttons";
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';

<Meta title="Design System|Buttons" component={PrimaryButton} />

# Buttons

Buttons are used to trigger actions within an application.

## Usage

Buttons are used to trigger internal actions within your web applications.

## Primary Buttons

Use primary buttons for the highest-priority action that the user must do to complete the task. Primary buttons should only be used once per page, though an additional primary button can appear within modals, popovers, or alerts when needed to signal critical actions.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <PrimaryButton onClick={action('button-click')}>Primary</PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary Buttons

Use secondary buttons for most non-primary actions throughout an interface such as back, reset, adding or creating an object, or other non-critical actions. See examples below.

<Story name="secondary">
  <SecondaryButton>Secondary</SecondaryButton>
</Story>

## Tertiary Buttons

Use tertiary buttons when there are 3 or more possible actions on the page and thereâ€™s clearly a prioritization of those actions (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Tertiary buttons are most often used to create a clear hierarchy of priority and importance of actions.

<Story name="tertiary">
  <TertiaryButton>Tertiary</TertiaryButton>
</Story>
