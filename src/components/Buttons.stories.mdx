Using addons

Add-ons are neat packages you can install and use with Storybook to gain additional functionality.

Let's add a documentation add-on which will allow us to create beautiful design system documentation.

Run the following command to install a few add-ons.

npm i -D @storybook/preset-create-react-app actions @storybook/addon-docs

We then need to tell Storybook that we'll be using this add-on and we can do that in main.js.

We'll be creating our documentation and stories using MDX. MDX is a format which lets you write JSX in your markdown files, and we can use it to create stories and documentation.

We can use MDX to document our components and create a style guide for our design system. To do that, we'll need a few additional things, known as add-ons.

Add the following to the addons array in main.js.

module.exports = {
  stories: ["../src/**/*.stories.(js|mdx)"],
  addons: ["@storybook/preset-create-react-app", "@storybook/addon-docs"]
};

Now we can document and create stories for our button components.

import { Meta, Story, Preview } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import { PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton, TertiaryButton } from "./Buttons";

<Meta title="Design System|Buttons" component={PrimaryButton} />
